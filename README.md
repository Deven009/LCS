LCS
===

The implementation of the Longest Common Sub-sequence (LCS) problem in C++. (Dynamic programming) 

The program takes 2 strings of characters and returns their longest common subsequence.

i.e: 
the longest common subsequence of "123456" and "10305" is "135" 
the longest common subsequence of "123456" and "153" is "13"
